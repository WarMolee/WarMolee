  <p>
    I am a Swedish student currently studying to become game Developer / tech artist. I have had a passion for games since I was young and on my freetime I love analyzing games and going into the details and choices other developers make when producing their games. I am still learning and I am very new to the Developer scene and have yet to find what I want to specialize in where I both succeed and feel comfortable in. I love learning and trying out new techniques or ideas.
