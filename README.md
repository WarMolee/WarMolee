  <p>
    I am a Swedish student currently studying to become game Developer / game Designer. I have had a passion for games since I was young and on my freetime I love reading into details and choices other developers make when producing their games. Creating a game around a single concept or idea and being able to expand or showcase it to players is something I want to try and do myself. I am still learning and is very new to the Developer scene and have yet to find what I want to specialice in where I both succeed and feel comfortable in. I love learning and trying out new techniques or ideas.
